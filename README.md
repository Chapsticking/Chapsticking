I'm a builder, a fixer, and a relentless problem solver. With over 13 years in the Air Force and a strong background in data analysis, I’ve made it my mission to create tools that make people's jobs easier. Especially when the tech isn’t always on their side (looking at you NIPRnet). I’ve led projects that range from offline statistical tools built in vanilla JavaScript to AI-driven systems that help airmen understand regulations and make smarter decisions.

I don’t just write code, I build solutions with purpose. Whether it's automating a tedious process, visualizing critical data, or making complex concepts easier to grasp, I’m always looking for ways to empower the people around me. I believe in learning by doing, and I’m not afraid to dive into the deep end if it means coming out smarter on the other side.

98% of the code I write is private but maybe someday that wil change!
